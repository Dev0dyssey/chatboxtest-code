# Future Work & Improvements

Potential future enhancements and improvements that could be implemented with more time and to bring the app to a production ready status

## 🧪 Testing
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for core components and utilities
- Add integration tests for API endpoint (`/api/stream`)
- Create end-to-end tests for the chat functionality and user flows
- Add component testing for React components (chat interface, onboarding, etc.)
- Implement test coverage reporting and establish coverage thresholds

## 🗄️ Database Implementation for Country Info
- Replace the current mock database (`src/mockDatabase/country-info.json`) with a proper database solution
- Consider options like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite depending on scale requirements
- Implement proper data models and schemas for country information
- Add database migration scripts and seeding functionality

## 🔧 AI Model Tools Registry
- Create a centralized tool registry system for AI model tools
- Move tool declarations from individual files to a structured registry
- Implement dynamic tool loading and registration
- Add proper typing and validation for tool schemas
- Enable easier addition and management of new tools

## 🏗️ Page.tsx Refactoring
- Break down the monolithic `src/app/page.tsx` component into smaller, focused components
- Implement proper separation of concerns (UI, business logic, state management)
- Extract custom hooks for complex state management
- Create dedicated components for different sections of the app
- Improve component reusability and maintainability

## 🎨 Global Stylesheet Refactoring
- Analyze and split `src/app/globals.css` into modular stylesheets
- Implement CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styles
- Create a design system with reusable utility classes

## Additional Considerations
- Performance optimization and lazy loading
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Error boundaries and better error handling
