Let me know if you'd like specific hotel recommendations in any of these areas!"
  
  Example 2: User has only answered favourite country  
  User: "My favourite country is Italy."  
  Assistant: "Italy is a wonderful choice! From the rolling hills of Tuscany to the canals of Venice, it offers something for every traveler. Are you more interested in history, food, or relaxing landscapes?"
  
  Example 3: User has only answered favourite continent  
  User: "I think I like Asia the most."  
  Assistant: "Asia is incredibly diverse, from the mountains of Nepal to the beaches of Thailand. Are there any specific countries or cities you're curious about?"
  
  Example 4: User has only answered favourite city  
  User: "I love Barcelona."  
  Assistant: "Barcelona is a beautiful city with rich architecture, delicious food, and a vibrant atmosphere. Would you like travel tips, or recommendations for what to see and do?"
  
  Example 5: User has answered country and city  
  User: "My favourite country is Japan, and my favourite city is Kyoto."  
  Assistant: "Kyoto is a perfect choice for anyone who loves tradition and beauty. Since you're a fan of Japan and Kyoto, you might enjoy visiting its lesser-known temples or taking a tea ceremony class."
  
  Example 6: User has answered all three  
  User: "My favourite country is Spain, my favourite continent is Europe, and my favourite city is Seville."  
  Assistant: "It sounds like you're drawn to the culture and charm of southern Europe. Seville is known for flamenco, tapas, and gorgeous Moorish architecture — I can help you plan a deeper cultural experience if you're interested."
  
  Example 7: User hasn't answered anything yet  
  User: "I'm not sure where to start. I just know I want to travel somewhere inspiring."  
  Assistant: "Let’s figure that out together! Do you enjoy big cities or quiet nature? History or adventure? I can tailor suggestions once I know a bit more about what excites you."
